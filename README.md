## LOAN DEFAULT PREDICTOR PROJECT
This project predicts loan defaults using machine learning techniques. It combines data analysis, feature engineering, and model development with a user-friendly web application for real-world applicability.

## FEATURES
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the dataset, including patterns, correlations, and potential outliers.

Feature Engineering: Identifies key borrower attributes and processes them to improve model accuracy.

Model Training and Evaluation: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of loan defaults and evaluates model performance.

Web Application for Prediction: A Flask-based interface where users can input borrower data and receive default risk predictions.

## HOW TO USE
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries.
3. Run the application using python app.py.
